# SignatureCheck
The model is developed based on keras architecture and Resnet50 convolutional neural network, and designed for classifying the completed signature and the incompleted signature. The accuracy is 90% at the test data.
The file,resnet50.pkl and resnet50_weights_th_dim_ordering_th_kernels_notop.h5, which is the predefined parameters,is needed in the train procedure.These two files can be obtained from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kVjuclD.
The final model also can be gained from  https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kVjuclD.
